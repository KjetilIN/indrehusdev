                        I started coding in High School with <span className="underline decoration-red decoration-4 underline-offset-8 ">Python</span>. The challege was the primary reason. My first code project was with python and challeging.
                        I created a game with using PyGame. It was terrible, but I spend a whole weekend on it. Later on I wanted more challege, so I stared learning 
                         <span className="underline decoration-red decoration-4 underline-offset-8"> C++ </span>. 
                        I used the laguage to primary solve coding challenges on Hackerrank. Later on I desided to persive a bachelor in <span className="underline decoration-red decoration-4 underline-offset-8">Data Engineer at NTNU Gj√∏vik.</span>
                         Today I am a student, with the same goal: find a challege!
